This is an add-on web application developed to solve another bottle neck issue faced by the officer in NEA EHI. This web application has 2 capability to solve 2 main problems. 

First:
In Project Wolbachia, only male mosquitoes can be release into the environment. At the puppae stage, male puppae are much smaller thn female puppae. 
A sample of puppae is measured through a highthroughput comptuter which differentiate the puppaes and measure them. A bimodal distribution curve is plotted where the left peak is the male and the right peak is the female. 
Currently, splitting of the bimodal distribution is done manually by looking at the graph. Human error and biasness might cause the splitting to be imprecise. 
The aim of this anaylzer is to utilize computational modelling (mixmodel package) to split the 2 distribution mathematically. Next, with the model, create an easy to use web application for employees at NEA to use.

Second:
In Project Wolbachia, Smart Gravitraps are placed all around Singapore to collect information on mosquitos density in the area. The smart gravitrap is able to detect mosquitoes (at species level and gender level) flying in and out of it. 
However, the data extracted is extremely messy with no form of orgnanisations whatsoever. The purpose of the web application is to clean up and manipulate the data so that users can extract it and make better anaylsis. 


The web application can be accessed via the website below: https://rshinyapplications.shinyapps.io/EHI_Data_Anaylzer_Final/

A sample dataset from the highthroughput computer and smart gravitrap data can be found in the data folder.
The output from the web application can also be seen in the output folder.
